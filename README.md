# Understanding Data Importance in Machine Learning Attacks: Does Valuable Data Pose Greater Harm?  

The code is designed for experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset but can be easily adapted to other datasets by replacing the dataset class. The implementation relies on the calculation of data importance values, for which we recommend the [Shapley-Study package](https://github.com/AI-secure/Shapley-Study).
